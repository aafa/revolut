### Money transfers

#### Task
Implement money transfers between accounts. 

Using Tech stack: `Finch` + `Circe`

#### API
- GET /accounts - returns back list of all accounts
- GET /account/$id - returns back account for given id or 404
- POST /account with NewAccountPayload - adds new account from payload details 
- POST /transfer with TransferPayload - creates money transfer from payload details, or 400 if not enough funds 

#### How to run

- `sbt ~reStart` for interactive development: server recompiled\restarted as you change something in a code 
- `sbt test` to run basic test scenarios

#### Load testing 
`wrk` has been used to do simple load testing for typical scenarios 
Tests were run after initial short 10s warm-up.

Here 3 consecutive scenarios has been tested
- add new accounts
- query particular account
- make money transfers between accounts
